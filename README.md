# ProjectMambaML
Random ML projects

According to Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamba), manbas are fast moving and venomous snakes. 

The code in this repo is like a mamba where it is written quickly to prove a concept hoping to find great value.

This repo contain jupyter notebooks of random data that are interesting to me and may have a great deal of correlation for machine learning.
